s="""you are watching a  movie  in the television and ads pop out . 
the ads that come in the middle of the movie depends on the movie that is currently playing 
if it is a new movie there then  probably we can expect more no of viewers and thus
no advertisements also increases and the type of ads depends on the type of movie for
example if it is action movie then we can expect more no of children ads like grooming
or phone ads etc. there is a particular order that at what time which ad should come for
example in the movie chase between hero and villain is going and at this time if ad comes
definitely we can expect automobile ads. This seems funny but there is a lot of impact on
your subconscious mind  Every company tries to place their ad when a good and pleasant  scene is going on."""
